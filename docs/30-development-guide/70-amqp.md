# AMQP

> The **Advanced Message Queuing Protocol** (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented 
> middleware. The defining features of AMQP are message orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security.

The chosen AMQP implementation for this project is [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), 
but it can be easily switched to for example [Amazon's](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/) AMQP solution.

## Registering new queues

To be able to queue your first message, you'll need to add a queue first.
Just create a new class (preferably in the write model) that extends `CommandQueue` 
and add the required `AsAmqpQueue` attribute to it:

```php showLineNumbers title="UserCommandQueue.php"
#[AsAmqpQueue(name: 'user-command-queue', numberOfWorkers: 1)]
class UserCommandQueue extends CommandQueue
{
}
```

That's it, easy right?

## Queueing commands

At this point you should be set up to start queueing commands. Inject your command queue in the class where
you want to queue commands and call the `queue()` method:

```php showLineNumbers
class YourService
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly UserCommandQueue $userCommandQueue
    ) {
    }

    public function aMethod(): void
    {
        $this->userCommandQueue->queue(new CreateUser(/*...*/));
    }
}
```

It's also possible to queue multiple commands at once:

```php showLineNumbers
$this->userCommandQueue->queueBatch([
    new CreateUser(/*...*/),
    new CreateUser(/*...*/),
    new CreateUser(/*...*/)
]);
```

## Consuming your queue

To process messages, each of your queues needs at least one consumer. 
You can start consuming a queue by executing

```bash
docker-compose run --rm php-cli bin/console app:amqp:consume user-command-queue
```

Where `user-command-queue` is the name defined in the `AsAmqpQueue` attribute of your queue class.
This command will run as long as needed and will keep consuming commands as soon as they
are pushed to the queue.

### Systemd

On a production environment you'll probably want to run this command as a background process.
You can do this by using *systemd*. SSH into your server and navigate to `âˆ¼/.config/systemd/user`.

There create a file named `user-command-queue-consumer@.service` and add the following contents:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Platform app:amqp:consume user-command-queue #%i
After=network-online.target
Requires=dbus.socket

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=[DIRECTORY-TO-ROOT-OF-APP]
ExecStart=bash -cl "php -f [DIRECTORY-TO-ROOT-OF-APP]/bin/console app:amqp:consume user-command-queue"
Restart=always
RestartSec=10s

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then start the process by running:

```bash
systemctl --user enable user-command-queue-consumer@1.service
systemctl --user start user-command-queue-consumer@1.service
```

This flow can be easily automated to set up new consumers after every new deploy.

## Failed queues

By default, when an exception is thrown while processing a command, the command will be
automatically pushed to a corresponding failed queue. This can be used as some kind of log where
you can see the commands that failed to be processed.

In this example, every failed command from the **user-command-queue** will be pushed to
**user-command-queue-failed**. The `CommandQueueWorker` will automatically take care of this

```php showLineNumbers title="CommandQueueWorker.php"
    public function processFailure(Envelope $envelope, AMQPMessage $message, \Throwable $exception, Queue $queue): void
    {
        /** @var \App\Infrastructure\CQRS\DomainCommand $command */
        $command = $envelope;
        $command->setMetaData([
            'exceptionMessage' => $exception->getMessage(),
            'traceAsString' => $exception->getTraceAsString(),
        ]);

        $this->failedQueueFactory->buildFor($queue)->queue($command);
    }
```

:::info 

A failed queue has no consumer attached to it, and thus, cannot be consumed. 
This means that the messages will stay on the queue until they are manually deleted.

:::

## Delayed queues

In more advanced use cases you might want to delay the consumption of commands, for example:

- a digist mail that summarizes all content changes occurred in the last 30 minutes
- requeue a failed message automatically after 15 seconds
- ...

You can do this by pushing the message to it's corresponding delayed queue:

```php
 $this->delayedQueueFactory->buildWithDelayForQueue(15, $queue)->queue($command);
```

For a delayed queue to work properly you'll have to do two things in the [RabbitMQ Management UI](/docs/30-development-guide/70-amqp.md#rabbitmq-management):

- Add a new exchange with the name `dlx`
- Make sure the queue is defined as a binding on the `dlx` exchange, where the routing key of the binding is the command queue name to where it has to be routed.

## RabbitMQ Management

RabbitMQ has a management UI module. Navigate to [http://localhost:15672/](http://localhost:15672/) and login with *rabbitmq/rabbitmq*.
There you will be able to see and manage your queues, messages, exchanges, ...
